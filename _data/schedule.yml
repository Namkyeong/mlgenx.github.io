  Abstract: Advances in scientific disciplines such as biology and medicine require solving causal problems such as learning optimal interventions or inferring causal structure. In this talk, I will introduce Functional Causal Bayesian Optimization, a graph-based sequential decision making method that considers contextual interventions, and DiscoGen, a supervised transformer-based method that enables inferring large and cyclic gene regulatory networks.

  Abstract: "The challenge of systematically modifying and optimizing regulatory elements for precise gene expression control is central to modern genomics and synthetic biology. Advancements in generative AI have paved the way for designing synthetic sequences with the aim of safely and accurately modulating gene expression. We leverage diffusion models to design context-specific DNA regulatory sequences, which hold significant potential toward enabling novel therapeutic applications requiring precise modulation of gene expression. Our framework uses a cell type-specific diffusion model to generate synthetic 200 bp DNA regulatory elements based on chromatin accessibility across different cell types. We evaluate the generated sequences based on key metrics to ensure they retain properties of endogenous sequences: transcription factor binding site composition, potential for cell type-specific chromatin accessibility, and capacity for sequences generated by DNA diffusion to activate gene expression in different cell contexts using state-ofthe- art prediction models. Our results demonstrate the ability to robustly generate DNA sequences with cell type-specific regulatory potential. DNA-Diffusion paves the way for revolutionizing a regulatory modulation approach to mammalian synthetic biology and precision gene therapy."

  Abstract: "Discrete diffusion or flow models could enable faster and more controllable sequence generation than autoregressive models. We show that naive linear flow matching on the simplex is insufficient toward this goal since it suffers from discontinuities in the training target and further pathologies. To overcome this, we develop Dirichlet flow matching on the simplex based on mixtures of Dirichlet distributions as probability paths. In this framework, we derive a connection between the mixtures' scores and the flow's vector field that allows for classifier and classifier-free guidance. Further, we provide distilled Dirichlet flow matching, which enables one-step sequence generation with minimal performance hits, resulting in O(L) speedups compared to autoregressive models. On complex DNA sequence generation tasks, we demonstrate superior performance compared to all baselines in distributional metrics and in achieving desired design targets for generated sequences. Finally, we show that our classifier-free guidance approach improves unconditional generation and is effective for generating DNA that satisfies design targets."

  Abstract: "In biology, interventions—particularly genetic ones enabled by CRISPR technologies—play a pivotal role in the study of complex systems. These interventions are instrumental in both identifying potential therapeutic targets and understanding the mechanisms of action for existing treatments. With the advancement of CRISPR and the proliferation of genome-scale analyses, the challenge shifts to navigating the vast combinatorial space of genetic interventions. Addressing this, our work concentrates on estimating the effects of pairwise genetic combinations. We introduce two novel contributions: Salt, a biologically-inspired baseline that posits the mostly additive nature of combination effects, and Peper, a deep learning model that extends Salt's additive assumption to achieve unprecedented accuracy. Our comprehensive comparison against existing state-of-the-art methods, grounded in diverse metrics, and our out-of-distribution analysis highlight the limitations of current models in realistic settings. This analysis underscores the necessity for improved modeling techniques and data acquisition strategies, paving the way for more effective exploration of genetic intervention effects."

  Abstract: "Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled success in mapping genomic DNA sequences to associated readouts such as protein–DNA binding. Beyond prediction, the goal of these networks is to then learn the underlying motifs (and their syntax) which drive genome regulation. Traditionally, this has been done by applying fragile and computationally expensive post-hoc analysis pipelines to trained models. Instead, we propose an entirely alternative method for learning motif biology from neural networks. We designed a mechanistically interpretable neural-network architecture for regulatory genomics, where motifs and their syntax are directly encoded and readable from the learned weights and activations, thus eliminating the need for post-hoc pipelines. Our model is also more robust to variable sequence contexts and against adversarial attacks, while attaining predictive performance comparable to its traditional counterparts."
